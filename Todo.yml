          - task: Provide support for delete
          - status: done
          - task: See if key and value should be string

          - task: Abstract rand.Intn(2)
          - status: pending
          - task: Verify the signature of put, do we want to return something
          - status: pending
          - task: Does SkipListNodes need a move constructor because collectNodes returns SkipListNodes which means copy constructor would be called and because SkipListNodes contains a vector of pointers it could cause issues
          - status: does not look like we need it (check again !!)
          - task: Add pre-condition checks in public methods, example towerSize >= 1
          - status: done
          - task: Add a logging library and build the same in pipeline
          - status: done
          - task: Hide SkipListNode and SkipListNodes, should not be visible outside library
          - status: pending
          - task: Move some behaviours from *Node classes to test fixture classes
          - status: pending
          - task: Relook at package structure, probably introduce kv/engine/skiplist/..
          - status: pending
          - task: Does SkipListNodeIterator need a move constructor
          - status: pending
          - task: Refactor iterate across
          - status: done
          - task: Add an integration test for update

          - task: Duplication in SkipListInternalNode, duplication in SkipListLeafNode
          - status: pending
          - task: Do we need to increase towersize?
          - status: no, for now
          - task: Change parameter of private methods to const reference to std::string instead of std::string 
          - status: pending
          - task: Optimize delete, currently it returns a previous down pointer to leaf which could be a long chain
          - status: pending
          - task: See if we can get rid of right pointer to SkipListLeafNode
          - status: pending
          - task: Snapshot while running code in transaction
          - status: pending
          - task: Probably separate iterator and writer interface
          - status: pending
          - task: handle deleteRange, relook at all the methods across all classes and remove the ones that are not needed
          - status: donne
          - task: take snapshot while writing transactionally in leaf nodes + handle rollback
          - status: pending
          - task: currently concurrency uses shared_mutex, shall we change it to have an event loop kind of structure
          - status: pending
          - task: improve the return types from internal nodes
          - status: pending
          - task: see if we want to flush skiplist changes, feedback by Karthik
