          - status: pending
          - task: Does SkipListNodes need a move constructor because collectNodes returns SkipListNodes which means copy constructor would be called and because SkipListNodes contains a vector of pointers it could cause issues
          - status: does not look like we need it (check again !!)
          - task: Add pre-condition checks in public methods, example towerSize >= 1
